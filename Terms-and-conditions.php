                        When you complete an order placement with us i.e. you make the payment, then you are considered
                        to have read, understood and agreed to terms and conditions listed on this page. These terms are
                        a legal contract between the client and Novella Publishers. By agreeing to order and use the
                        services from Novella Publishers you are deemed to be bound by the terms which as stated as
                        follows.

                    <h3>We Deliver Original Content Only</h3>
                    <p>
                        We guarantee you plagiarism free content. To ensure that content is original we provide you with
                        a Copyscape report. (Note: Any text contained in images, videos or other media, which search
                        engines can't read will not be scanned by Copyscape.) You may go for more comprehensive and
                        deeper plagiarism checks than Copyscape by yourself because we do not cover such services in our
                        standard prices. You can be sure of the work you get from Novella Publishers in terms of its
                        originality.

                        images that may suit the content. Otherwise, you may use royalty free images without any worry.
                        However, for copyright images, you may be required to pay the owner(s).

                    <p>
                        In case of late delivery due to some minor technical errors, such as grammatical, typing, word
                        count, missing references etc., refunds will be processed with mutual agreement and the company
                        will only settle with partial refund or discounts reserved for future purchases.
                        The company will not be responsible for any delay from the client’s end.
                        No refund will be issued on the basis of low writing.
                        For book marketing/publishing projects, no refund will be issued if the client is unable to
                        provide access to either their book stores (Amazon, Barnes & Noble etc.) or their social media
                        channels which helps our team to maximize reach, engagement and sales.
