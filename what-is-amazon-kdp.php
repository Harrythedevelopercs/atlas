                        <p>If you’ve ever dreamed of publishing your own book, chances are you’ve come across Amazon
                            KDP, short for Kindle Direct Publishing. And rightly so. Amazon KDP is one of the fastest,
                            easiest, and most accessible platforms for turning your manuscript into a published eBook or
                            paperback and reaching millions of readers around the world.</p>
                        <p>But what exactly is Amazon KDP? How does it work? And how can you make sure your book doesn’t
                            just get published, but gets discovered and sells?</p>
                        <p>Grab a pen (or open your notes app), because we’re about to break down Amazon KDP from A to
                            Z, and show you how Atlas Publishing Group can make your publishing journey easier,
                            smoother, and more profitable.</p>
                        <h2>What is Amazon KDP?</h2>
                        <p>Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing is a self-publishing platform. It allows authors to publish
                            eBooks and paperbacks directly to Amazon without needing a traditional publishing deal. It’s
                            completely free to use, offers global distribution, and gives you up to 70% royalties on
                            eBook sales. Whether you’re a fiction writer, non-fiction expert, children’s author, or
                            entrepreneur with a brilliant idea, KDP gives you the tools to launch your book in the
                            biggest online bookstore on the planet.</p>
                        <h2>The Problem Most Authors Face</h2>
                        <p>Most first-time authors think, “If I publish it, people will buy it.” Spoiler alert: They
                            won’t. With millions of titles on Amazon, your book can easily vanish into obscurity if it’s
                            not properly optimized. Without the right keywords, categories, cover design, description,
                            and marketing plan, your dream book might gather dust, even on a digital shelf. That’s why
                            most self-published books never sell more than a handful of copies.</p>
